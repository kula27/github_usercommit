The files I have submitted are Azure databricks notebooks in Python
I couldn't share notebooks hence I have copied in textpad. To run this code, you will have to copy this in Azure databricks Notebook and run cell
I have used Azure Key Vault and Databricks Scope to store API access token
I have assumed only public repositories for a user and considered only default branh as Main
I have filtered out commits done by input user only
